    <Workplace when="(2020.10 - 2022.05.)" title="socialbakers (now emplify)">
      At Socialbakers, I worked as a JavaScript developer on the Dashboard
      product, an analytical hub designed to give users a comprehensive overview
      of their social media performance. The Dashboard allowed users to create
      customizable dashboards with multiple widgets to monitor key metrics
      across various social networks and profiles. This tool was essential for
      optimizing customer engagement and social media strategies.

    <Workplace title="01People" when="(2022.4. - 2022.8.)">
      At 01People, I worked as a Front-End Developer on Hilbi, a platform
      designed to facilitate healthcare interactions. My primary focus was
      developing the front-end features and the React Native app, which enabled
      functionalities such as patient-doctor communication, medication
      prescriptions, participation in health studies, and tracking of vital
      data.

    <Workplace title="health issues" when="(2022.8. - 2023.8.)">
      I had to quit work for some time in order to focus on my health. Actually
      I wasn't even able to work. But I've been trying to keep up with the tech
      industry, kept learning and doing some side projects. For example (link to
      the HabitSync) was developed during this time.
    </Workplace>
    <Workplace title="freelance" when="(2023.10 - 2024.05)">
      I've been freelancing for a while now. For example I've been working on an
      app for an app for international basketball tournament. You can find more
      about it here (add link to Eastercup).
