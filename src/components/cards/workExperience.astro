    <Workplace when="(2020.10 - 2022.05.)" title="socialbakers (now emplify)">
      At Socialbakers, I worked as a JavaScript developer on the Dashboard
      product, an analytical hub designed to give users a comprehensive overview
      of their social media performance. The Dashboard allowed users to create
      customizable dashboards with multiple widgets to monitor key metrics
      across various social networks and profiles.

    <Workplace title="01People" when="(2022.4. - 2022.8.)">
      At 01People, I worked as a typescript dev on Hilbi, a platform designed to
      facilitate healthcare interactions. My primary focus was developing the
      front-end features on the web app and also the React Native app, which
      enabled functionalities such as patient-doctor communication, medication
      prescriptions, participation in health studies, and tracking of vital
      data.

    <Workplace title="health issues" when="(2022.8. - 2023.8.)">
      I had to quit work for some time because of serious health issues. But
      I've been trying to keep up with the tech industry, kept learning and
      doing some side projects. For example <ProjectLink
        href="/projects/habitsync"
        text="Habitsync"
        baseSize
      />
      was developed during this time.

    <Workplace title="freelance" when="(2023.10 - 2024.05)">
      I've been freelancing for a while now. For example I've been working on an
      app for an app for international basketball tournament. You can find more
      about it here <ProjectLink
