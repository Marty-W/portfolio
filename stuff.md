**About Me**

Hi there! I'm Martin Weber, a passionate front-end developer with a knack for creating engaging and user-friendly web applications. My journey into the world of programming began in 2019, after I decided to pivot from med school to follow my true passion for technology. As the go-to tech guy in my family, I always found joy in troubleshooting and fixing gadgets, which naturally led me to explore coding.

My first professional role was at Socialbakers in 2020, where I worked as a JavaScript developer on Emplify—a platform designed to boost employee engagement. During my 1.5 years there, I not only honed my JavaScript skills but also developed a deep appreciation for front-end development.

In 2022, I joined 01People and worked on Hilbi, a project in the healthcare sector. This role allowed me to expand my expertise to the backend with Node.js, providing a well-rounded development experience. However, life threw me a curveball when I faced a major health challenge. I had to take a break from full-time work to focus on my recovery from cancer. Despite this, I remained committed to my growth as a developer by learning new skills and working on side projects.

After my recovery, I contributed to Eastercup, an app for an international youth basketball tournament. This project further solidified my experience in both front-end and back-end development, showcasing my resilience and dedication to the craft.

I have a strong preference for TypeScript due to its type safety and scalability and have extensive experience with React for front-end development and Node.js for backend tasks. I also dabbled in React Native, adding another dimension to my skill set.

Coding is not just a job for me—it's a craft. I love optimizing my workflow with Neovim, a split keyboard, and custom remaps and keyboard shortcuts, which make my development process both efficient and enjoyable.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy [mention any hobbies or interests here].

I'm excited to bring my skills, passion, and unique journey to new projects. Let's build something amazing together!
